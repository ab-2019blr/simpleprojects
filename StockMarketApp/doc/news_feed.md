# News Feed Aggregation from external API

### Here’s a comprehensive comparison of different news feed providers, focusing on Indian NSE & Stock Market news coverage, and their Python integration:

| **Provider** | **NSE News Coverage** | **Free Tier Usage** | **Python Integration** | **Notes** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Marketaux | Market-wide, global, NSE tickers | Liberal (API key) | Easy, well-documented | Global + India focus |
| Tradient | All Indian stocks, market-wide | Free, generous | Easy, fast, code samples | High uptime, real-time |
| IndianAPI.in | NSE/BSE per company | Open, flexible | REST, JSON, easy | Detailed stock + news |
| News API | India business headlines | Moderate (API key) | Straightforward | Not NSE-specific |
| Alpha Vantage | Price data only | Restrictive | Easy, good docs | No NSE news, price only |


### Recommendations:

- Tradient Market News API is highly competitive for Indian NSE/BSE news: developer-friendly, truly broad Indian market coverage, and liberal free access. A top choice if you need full-market headlines and technicals in your Streamlit/dashboard app.

- Indian Stock Exchange API (IndianAPI.in) excels for company-specific news and data: best for dashboards focusing on individual stocks, not broad market news aggregators. Integration and queries are simple for Python apps.

- Marketaux is your best “all purpose” option for both global and Indian market-wide stock headlines, with international source aggregation and generous free tier.

- News API works for broad business headlines but lacks NSE-specific depth; Alpha Vantage should be used only for pure price/history needs, not news.


### Optimal Approach:

For a robust, scalable dashboard showing both aggregate market news and stock-specific headlines for Indian/NSE stocks, use Tradient Market News API for market-wide updates and IndianAPI.in for specific company feeds. If you want international context, then you can keep Marketaux in your stack.

The others may be better for general news (News API) or price data (Alpha Vantage), but are not optimal for Indian stock headlines.
