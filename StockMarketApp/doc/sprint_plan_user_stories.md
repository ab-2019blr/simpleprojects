## Dependencies & Critical Path

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Epic 1 → Epic 2**: Database schema must be complete before data processing
2. **Epic 2 → Epic 3**: Data infrastructure required for UI development
3. **Epic 3 → Epic 4**: Core UI needed before advanced features
4. **All Epics → Epic 6**: Testing requires completed features
5. **Epic 6 → Epic 7**: Quality assurance before production deployment

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Epic 4 (Advanced Features) can run parallel with Epic 3 (UI) after Sprint 8
- Epic 5 (Automation) can start parallel with Epic 4 after Sprint 12
- Epic 6 (Testing) should run continuously from Sprint 6 onwards
